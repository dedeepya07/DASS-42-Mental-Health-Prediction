DASS-42 ML Prediction

This project focuses on predicting mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and stress using responses to the DASS-42 (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) questionnaire. By leveraging a variety of machine learning models, this study demonstrates the ability to classify mental health conditions with remarkable accuracy, providing a foundation for further research and applications in mental health diagnostics.

Project Overview

The DASS-42 questionnaire is a widely used psychological assessment tool designed to measure emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. The dataset used in this project consists of responses to the DASS-42 questionnaire, which were preprocessed and transformed to align with the requirements of machine learning algorithms. The project explores several models, evaluates their performance, and achieves 100% accuracy with certain algorithms, underscoring the dataset’s separability and the effectiveness of the chosen approaches.

Objectives
	1.	To preprocess and clean the dataset for effective predictive modeling.
	2.	To apply multiple supervised learning algorithms and evaluate their performance on the classification task.
	3.	To analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning techniques in mental health prediction.

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing
	•	The dataset was loaded and inspected for quality and consistency.
	•	Responses to the DASS-42 questionnaire were transformed, with response values originally ranging from 1 to 4 remapped to a 0 to 3 scale for better compatibility with machine learning models.
	•	Irrelevant columns, such as geographical data (country) and academic background (major), were removed to avoid introducing noise and to improve performance.

2. Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated:
	•	Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Delivered 100% accuracy, highlighting its ability to effectively classify data with clear decision boundaries.
	•	Logistic Regression: Also achieved 100% accuracy, proving the dataset’s strong linear separability.
	•	Random Forest: Leveraged ensemble learning to combine multiple decision trees for robust predictions.
	•	Decision Tree: Applied as a baseline model for interpretability and simplicity.
	•	Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model that provided quick and accurate predictions.
	•	XGBoost: Utilized for its boosting capabilities, offering high efficiency and precision.

3. Model Evaluation

Each model was rigorously evaluated to compare their accuracy, precision, recall, and overall performance. The standout performers were the SVC and Logistic Regression models, both achieving perfect classification accuracy.

4. Insights and Visualizations

Throughout the project, visualizations were employed to provide a deeper understanding of the dataset and model predictions. This includes:
	•	Distribution plots of the DASS-42 responses.
	•	Comparison of model performance metrics to highlight strengths and limitations.

Key Results
	•	100% accuracy was achieved with the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Logistic Regression, demonstrating the dataset’s strong linear characteristics.
	•	Ensemble methods, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, also provided competitive results, emphasizing the importance of feature interaction.
	•	Probabilistic approaches like Naive Bayes were quick to implement and effective, making them suitable for simpler applications.

Applications and Future Directions

This project provides a significant step forward in using machine learning for mental health diagnostics. It lays a foundation for building scalable, AI-driven systems to assist psychologists and clinicians in identifying mental health conditions.

Future Enhancements
	•	Feature Engineering: Introduce advanced techniques to extract and select the most relevant features for classification.
	•	Deep Learning Models: Explore neural networks for processing larger, more complex datasets.
	•	Interpretability Tools: Implement methods like SHAP or LIME to provide detailed explanations for predictions, enhancing trust in the models.
	•	Expanded Dataset: Train the models on larger datasets to generalize the findings across diverse populations.

Conclusion

The DASS-42 ML Prediction project highlights the power of machine learning in tackling complex classification tasks in the domain of mental health. By exploring a variety of algorithms, this study showcases the potential for accurate, data-driven insights into emotional well-being, paving the way for innovative solutions in the mental health sector.
